ProjectEuler
============

My solutions to the problems on Project Euler. The numerical answers aren't included. 

Solutions are written in mostly JavaScript (ran via NodeJS), but there are a couple done in Python.

My first approach is normally brute force. When brute force doesn't complete in under a minute, a more effecient algorithm is investigated.
